# Telerik UI for Blazor Sample Projects

This repository contains examples related to [Telerik UI for Blazor](https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui) that are not part of the documentation or demos. They provide scenarios and answers to common how-to questions. For most of them, a component and some classes are the core of the example.

This repo also contains two larger [sample applications](sample-applications).

## Package References

The projects usually reference a commercial version of UI for Blazor. If you only have a trial license, replace the reference to the NuGet package and to the JS Interop file and/or Theme [accordingly](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/getting-started/what-you-need).

The references (both to Telerik UI for Blazor, and the .NET framework) are usually up-to-date for the time of creation. You may need to update to their latest versions and make any necessary changes. The Blazor framework is evolving rapidly and these examples may not get their references updated all the time. Nevertheless, the general approaches should remain valid, barring breaking changes in the framework.
