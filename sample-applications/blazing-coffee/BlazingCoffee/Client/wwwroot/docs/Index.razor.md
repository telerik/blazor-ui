# Features you'll find here include

## Localization

This page uses standard <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/globalization-localization?view=aspnetcore-5.0" target="_blank">localization</a> to change texts the user sees.

## Application State

Setting for the UI for the app (such as menu collapsed/expanded state and other component-specific setup) are stored in the application state so the user comes back to the same UI they left.

## Telerik TileLayout Component

The <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/tilelayout/state" target="_blank">Tile Layout State</a> is saved and restored so the users sees the changes they made the next time they visit the app.
